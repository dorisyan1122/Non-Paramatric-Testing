Ivy and Doris's assignment06: non-parametric statistics and hypothesis testing. We replicate [Martinez et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2017-000213) by using a non-parametric approach to evaluate the impact of a complementary feeding intervention on stunted Guatemalan children. The outcome variable is height-for-age Z score. Through hypothesis testing, we compare pre-post differences between the control and treatment group. We conclude that the mean change in height-for-age Z score in the treatment group is not statistically from that in the control control. The non-parametric testing reaches the same conclusion as the paper–the complementary feeding education program does not improve stunted children’ height-for-age Z score.
