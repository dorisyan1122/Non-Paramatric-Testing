Ivy and Doris's assignment06: non-parametric statistics and hypothesis testing. We replicate the study by [Martinez et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2017-000213) by using a non-parametric approach to evaluate the impact of a complementary feeding intervention on stunted Guatemalan children. The outcome variable is height-for-age Z score.

We compare pre and post-differences between the control and treatment groups through hypothesis testing. We conclude that the treatment group's mean change in height-for-age Z score is not statistically different from that in the control. The non-parametric testing reaches the same conclusion as the paper–the complementary feeding education program does not improve stunted children’s height-for-age Z score.
